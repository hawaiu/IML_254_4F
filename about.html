    <h2 class="section-title">A little bit of myself</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Hawa Nabila binti Hanif. I'm 20 years old. My birtdate is 6 December 2004. I was born in Medan, Indonesia. I currently reside in Bandar Sri Permaisuri, Kuala Lumpur. I have three siblings and I am the eldest. </p>
	
    <p>People are often curious about my birth in Indonesia. To explain, my late father, who was Malaysian, married my mother, who was Indonesian. When I was in my mother’s womb, she was in Indonesia, and I was born prematurely before she could return to Malaysia.</p>
    
    <p>As I mentioned earlier, my mother was Indonesian but is now Malaysian as she has obtained her blue identity card (IC). Acquiring the blue IC was a challenging process due to the many procedures involved at the time. However, I did not need to undergo these procedures as my late father was Malaysian. People often ask if I hold a blue or red IC due to their lack of understanding of the IC system. I hope that my explanation will help people become more informed and open-minded about Malaysia’s IC system.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Education</h2>
    <div class="education-section">
        <h3>Sekolah Kebangsaan Seri Tasik (2011-2016)</h3>
        <p>I was an active student in my primary school, particularly in sports, rather than academics. I admit that I struggled academically and disliked studying, preferring to focus on sports as I was an athlete. However, my parents were always supportive and assured me that as long as I excelled in one area, they would be proud of me regardless of what others said.</p>
        
	<h3>Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seri Tasik (2017-2022)</h3>
        <p>Due to COVID-19, we had to extend our time in school to complete our studies and take the SPM examination, earning us the nickname "batch Pro Max." From 2017 to 2019, I remained indifferent to academics. However, in Form 4, I found the motivation to study, perhaps because SPM was approaching. I was initially lost on how to study effectively, but my best friend, Amirah, helped me, especially with Mathematics. Thanks to her, we both achieved excellent SPM results and continued our studies at UiTM—she at UiTM Lendu and I at UiTM Merbok.</p>

	<p>I was in the 'Aliran Sastera' stream, taking subjects like Perniagaan, Ekonomi, and Muzik. For your information, the music subject was limited for our batch, and the teacher had to select the students. There were only three students chosen, and I was one of them!</p>

        <h3>UiTM Merbok (2022-2025)</h3>
        <p>Here I am at UiTM Merbok! Initially, I was devastated when I received the offer to study here because it's far from home, and I wasn't ready to be away from my family. But, with the encouragement of my friends and family, I accepted the offer. My passion for books has inspired me to pursue a diploma in Informatics Library. Now, I'm in my fourth semester, with only one more semester to go!</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Work Experience</h2>
    <div class="workexperience-section">
        <h3>Food & Beverages (Chicken Rice Shop)</h3>
        <p>To be honest, I didn’t really want to work after SPM. I was completely exhausted from studying from dawn to sunset, and all I wanted was to rest and sleep for a month. That's what I thought back then.</p>
        <p>However, after a week of doing nothing, I realized I needed to do something productive. So, I decided to work at the Chicken Rice Shop. It was my first real job, and it turned out to be a valuable experience. Working there taught me a lot about responsibility, time management, and teamwork. I learned how to handle customers, manage time efficiently, and work under pressure, which were all new skills for me. Plus, I earned my own money for the first time, which gave me a sense of independence and pride.</p>
        <p>Although it was tiring at times, I made some great friends and had fun moments with my colleagues. We would share stories during breaks, and I even picked up a few tips on cooking chicken rice! Looking back, I'm glad I took the job. It gave me a new perspective on hard work and the importance of balancing work and rest.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>Did you know that I am funny? I love sharing these little tidbits as they showcase a different side of me!</p>
    <p>1. Bookworm and Athlete Combo: I may be passionate about books now, but in primary school, I was all about sports! Who knew a sporty kid could turn into a library lover?</p>
    <p>2. Early Bird Arrival: I was so eager to see the world that I arrived early, born in Indonesia while my mom was supposed to give birth in Malaysia. Impatient from the start! Em...until now I guess.</p>
    <p>3. Multicultural Family: My family is a blend of Malaysian and Indonesian cultures, which means I get to celebrate double the festivals and enjoy the best of both cuisines!</p>
    <p>4. Musical Trio: I was one of the lucky three chosen to study music in my batch. Not only did we learn music, but we also became an exclusive mini-band!</p>
    <p>5. Informatics Enthusiast: My journey from hating academics to pursuing a diploma in Informatics Library is proof that passions can evolve in the most unexpected ways.</p>
